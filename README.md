This is a camera-trap data analysis of four field seasons for the study of snow leopard (Panthera uncia) in Naryn State reserve, performed thanks to citizen science expeditions. From this camera trap monitoring, we could detect a minimal population of five adults, caught every year with an equilibrated sex ratio and reproduction. These individuals and their cubs are living inside and around our sampled area. Frequencies of crossing of one to three times along the year were observed in front of most camera traps with higher rates of several times a month in front of one of them. Significant snow leopard presence was observed in the buffer area which strongly advocates for extending the protection measures of the core zone to this area.
